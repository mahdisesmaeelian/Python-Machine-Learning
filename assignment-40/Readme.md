# Titanic - Machine Learning
## Use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.

## result :
| Algorithm | KNN | Perceptron | MLP (Multi Layer Perceptron)|
| :---:         |     :---:      |        :---: | :---:|
| Accuracy  |0.87%   |0.79%  | 0.83%|

### The data has been split into two groups:

training set (train.csv)

test set (test.csv)
